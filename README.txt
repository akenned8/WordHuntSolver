wordhunt.py takes in 16 characters from the 4x4 Word Hunt board. The characters on the board should be entered from top to bottom and left to right as they appear on the board. Enter contiguously in lowercase without spaces. Then it loops through currdict.txt, which contains ~192k words of length 9 through 6 and prints out matching words to the standard output.
